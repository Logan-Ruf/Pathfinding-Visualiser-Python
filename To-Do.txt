To Do List - In order of most important to least important.


Merge pathfinder2d and pathfinder3 Files:

        Merge PathFinder2D and PathFinder2D Classes(URGENT):

                Add a new method to the PathFinder2D Class to represent your
                algorithm. Try to name it after whatever algorithm you will be
                mimicking. Make sure there are no duplicate class names and that
                every function can be accessed from a positiondata object.

        Merge MapMaker and PositionData Classes:

                PositonData already has methods to change start, end, and wall
                tiles. Add whatever code you need to each of those methods for your
                pathFinder method to work properly.


Set up imports in the following order:

        tile >> grid >> positiondata
        pathfinder2d >> positiondata
        positiondata >> main

        I believe python can handle duplicate imports so if you
        need the same module in tile and pathfinder2d go ahead and import it
        twice. Main should only have positiondata imported to it and any other
        modules needed should be imported through one of the other class files.
