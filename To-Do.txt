To Do List - In order of most important to least important.


Merge pathfinder2d and pathfinder3 Files:Done
there is only PathFinder2D with 2 methods for each algorithm


Nic -

Set up imports in the following order:

        tile >> grid >> positiondata
        pathfinder2d >> positiondata
        positiondata >> main

        I believe python can handle duplicate imports so if you
        need the same module in tile and pathfinder2d go ahead and import it
        twice. Main should only have positiondata imported to it and any other
        modules needed should be imported through one of the other class files.

Add more things to the To Do list. Lol
